#StandAlonePHPScript

An Implementation of ResultsScanner, This script will complete the task given to it (currently to get all Results from [BioTech Branch from 2008](https://github.com/ShootingKing-AM/GitamResultsScanner/blob/master/Examples/StandAlonePHPScript/index.php#L9) to Mechanical Enginner Branch)
once its executed. It will not halt until it completes the task because of [set_time_limit(0)](https://github.com/ShootingKing-AM/GitamResultsScanner/blob/master/Examples/StandAlonePHPScript/index.php#L4).
